## Gameplay

A two player co-op game, with elements of a classic 2d platformer game.
Both players have to reach a special glowing spot on the map (the 'comet') to
complete the level. To do so, they have to create blocks out of thin air -
which unfortunately makes another block somewhere else on the map vanish.
